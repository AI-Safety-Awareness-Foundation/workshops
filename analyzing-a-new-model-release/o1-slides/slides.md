# Questions we want to answer

+ How could you have predicted the announcement of o1-preview and o1-mini before September, 2024?
+ How could you have figured out on December 5th, 2024 that something was amiss with the model?
+ How could you make sense of the o1 announcement?
    * What information is actually contained in the announcement of the model?
    * What benchmarks are usually talked about?
    * How big of a jump in capabilities does o1 actually represent?
    * What sources of information could you go to to understand this?
    * How could you analyze this for yourself?
    * How surprising is o1?

# Why is this a big deal

+ Difficult for us to fully replicate OpenAI's testing results!
+ Seems indicative 

# OpenAI is being mildly deceptive about inaccuracy in initial release

+ [https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/) claims updated Dec 5th
    * Not actually true (compare against Wayback Machine)
    * Makes it seem like info about `o1-near-final-checkpoint` was always there
      (it wasn't! Was added after Dec 5th)
+ System card PDF also claims updated Dec 5th
    * Also not true
+ How would you be able to tell?

# How would you have known?
