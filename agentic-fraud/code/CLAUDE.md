# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains code for an "agentic-fraud" workshop that is part of a series of AI safety workshops. This will be a frontend JavaScript project that demonstrates how an AI could potentially carry out autonomous fraud - for educational and research purposes.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently minimal but will be expanded with JavaScript code for a frontend application.

## Dependencies

- `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`: A package developed by Anthropic for Claude Code functionality.
- Additional frontend JavaScript dependencies will be added as the project develops (e.g., React, Vue, etc.)

## Available Commands

Common frontend JavaScript commands will include:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start development server: `npm start` or `npm run dev` (to be added)
- Build for production: `npm run build` (to be added)

## Development Guidance

When working on this codebase:

1. This is an AI safety workshop focused specifically on agentic fraud scenarios
2. The code is for educational and research purposes only, demonstrating potential risks and vulnerabilities
3. Follow standard JavaScript/frontend best practices
4. All code should be clearly documented to explain its educational purpose
5. The project should demonstrate techniques for preventing and detecting autonomous fraudulent behavior
6. UX design should clearly indicate the educational nature of the application
